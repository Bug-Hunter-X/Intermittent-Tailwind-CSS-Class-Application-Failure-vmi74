# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied, even with seemingly correct usage.  The issue is intermittent and not easily reproducible, affecting only certain classes.

## Bug Description

Tailwind classes are sometimes ignored, leading to unexpected styling. This is likely due to a conflict with other CSS or a problem with the Tailwind CSS build process itself.  The behavior is inconsistent, making debugging difficult. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the application.
4. Observe that certain Tailwind classes are not applied correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing your build process to ensure that Tailwind is properly processing and applying styles.  This could involve cleaning build artifacts, checking for CSS conflicts, or verifying the proper integration of Tailwind with your framework (if used).  It is important to examine if there is a specificity issue where some styles are overriding the Tailwind styles unintentionally.
