```javascript
// Ensure your Tailwind config is correct and that the build process is correctly compiling your styles.
// Clean your build artifacts.
// Verify there are no conflicting CSS rules that have higher specificity.
// Consider adding !important (use cautiously) to the class if it's a very specific problem.
// Check the browser developer tools to ensure the class is actually present in the HTML and that the styling is applied
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 !important">
  <p>This is some text</p>
</div>
